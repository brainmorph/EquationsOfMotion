# EquationsOfMotion
Studying and building the 6DoF equations of motion from scratch - no libraries.

You will find mistakes and messy work in progress, I trust this to be the essence of learning.
It will be cleaned up and reorganized with time as things fall into place naturally.

If I don't understand it, it's not in this repo.  Ask me anything.

Q: Are you using LLMs?
A: Yes of course I am using LLMs, the same way I use books and google - as references.  Nothing is copied/pasted and nothing is autogenerated.
The immediate goal is the satisfaction of learning and understanding a flight dynamics model completely, from the ground up.
This is a project dedicated to younger David who would have loved nothing more than to be able to be part of constructing something like this.

The future goal will be to couple this to a control system architecture and run it with hardware in the loop.  Eventually, we might be flying for real :)
